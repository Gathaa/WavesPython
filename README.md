One project idea related to waves in Python could be to create a program that allows the user to input either the wavelength, period or frequency of a wave, and then generates a graph of the wave.
To create this project, you could use Python libraries like NumPy and Matplotlib. NumPy can be used to generate a range of x-values for the wave, and then calculate the corresponding y-values based on the input wavelength, period or frequency. Matplotlib can then be used to plot the wave on a graph.
